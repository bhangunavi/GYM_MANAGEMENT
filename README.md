Install dependencies: This project does not require many external dependencies for the frontend, but you should ensure your Firebase CLI is set up properly for deployment.

How to Run the Project
Firebase Setup: You need to have a Firebase project set up to use Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication for login and data storage.

Go to the Firebase Console.
Create a new Firebase project.
Set up Firestore and Firebase Authentication.
Configure Firebase in the Project:

In your Firebase console, go to Project Settings and find your Firebase configuration (API keys, project ID, etc.).
Replace the Firebase configuration in your project’s firebase-config.js file with your own Firebase credentials:
javascript
Copy code
// firebase-config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

// Initialize Firebase
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
Deploy the App (optional):

To deploy your project to Firebase Hosting, first ensure that Firebase CLI is properly set up, then run:
bash
Copy code
firebase login
firebase init
firebase deploy
Start the Project:

After configuring Firebase, open the index.html file in your browser to view the project locally.
Or, if you have deployed it to Firebase, view the project by visiting the Firebase Hosting URL.
Firebase Configuration
To ensure Firebase is properly integrated with the project, follow these steps:

Firebase Firestore: Create necessary collections and documents for gym members, bills, and notifications.
Firebase Authentication: Enable Email/Password Authentication for secure member and admin login.
Firebase Hosting: Deploy your project to Firebase Hosting for easy access to the live version of your Gym Management System.
